👋 Hi, I’m @summitgames

My professional journey began as a game/software engineer in the Gaming Industry. Having a deep inquisition for the entertainment industry, creatives like film and gaming that require innovative technological solutions was his inspiration.

Background >>>
Fast forward, now, it involves 8+ years of industry experience in the XR innovative tech. I, thus, have the gratitude of contributing to 12+ Gaming and 30+ AR and VR Projects, and 3+ Enterprise Applications. (development platforms adopting Unity 3D and Unreal Engine.)

👀 I’m interested in
Deployment of XR | IOT| Drones and Enterprise Software Solutions, for instance, Social VR (Metaverse), Virtual Production (Realtime VFX), Entertainment Installations (VR 360 Dome Theatre, VR Simulators, Projection & Crystal LED Motion Sensors), Education and Training, VR Virtual Meeting, Virtual Telepresence & Collaboration(HoloLens), 3D Photogrammetry Solutions (Lidar and Point Cloud Systems), 3D Volumetric Video Content Solutions, Live Events & 360 Video Broadcasting, Construction & Machinery Industrial Solutions, Museum AR experiences, Real-Estate VR Walkthroughs, Architectural Solutions, 5G 360 VR Streaming Content Products, Virtual Shopping and VR Games.


Skills >>>
While creating a strong foundation for a startup, my expertise/skills/experience in Lead Software Development, Program Management, Technical (System Design & Software Architecture) and Design (3D Assets Content Creation pipeline, User Experience) for an enterprise XR product.


🌱 I’m currently learning
Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, Machine Learning and AI. Technologoes that binds with hardware such as robotics,IOT, Drones, and mapping the data using Blockchain.


💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
Product & Design Solutions:
>> Virtual Production (Unreal Engine)
>> Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality (XR) Solutions
>> Realtime VFX (Rendering) (Raytracing, Motion Capture, Rendering Live) for Films
>> Computer Vision and AI & ML based Technical Solution
>> Enterprise Application Development
>> Game Design & Development
>> Live Events Broadcasting (AR & VR)
>> Hardware Simulator Systems for VR
>> 360 Video (Production)
>> 3D Asset Development Pipeline (Characters, Avatars, CG Environment, Animations)
>> Microcontrollers (Arduino | Rasberry Pi)
>> Architectural Solutions (Real Estate)
>> 3D Binaural/Spatial Audio VR Development

I further, conduct workshops/hackathons as a Speaker/Trainer in-game architecture and programming subjects. He provides training on emerging technology such as AR, VR, and MR. (XR Industry)

I am delighted to contribute to moderate XR Courses as an engineering subject in Universities.

I looks forward to sharing his experience and knowledge via writing articles and white papers and books.
